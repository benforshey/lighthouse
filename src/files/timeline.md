  Over a century-and-a-half of history exists on the building and lot we now
  know as the Lighthouse Community Center. Follow along the timeline to see our
  rich history.
event:
  - date: '1866'
    description: "Built by\_Maurice Moore in 1866, a local tobacconist responsible for the highly praised “Killikinnick” brand of tobacco. It took him 3 years to build his personal residence."
  - date: '1869'
    description: Maurice Moore moved with his family into the house in 1869.
  - date: '1870'
    description: >-
      Soon after, the ravine at 13th St was filled in and the foot bridge was
      removed to become a road which is now known as Church St. This was the
      ONLY access to Diamond Hill back in 1870. This mansion was dubbed “Moore’s
      Folly” (and eventually “The Folly”) because of its construction on such an
      improbable site. Chambers writes, “What appeared from the front to be the
      first floor was in actuality the third; so steep was the slope that the
      two full additional floors above a basement were above grade in the rear.”
  - date: '1887'
    description: "Moore died in 1887 and his wife Sarah Snead and their children\_lived in the house for another 40 years."
  - date: '1927'
    description: >-
      The house was sold in 1927. It was purchased by the “Virginia Art Goods
      Studio” to be used as a factory for ladies hand bags. The company retained
      the original look of the house for 5 more years.
  - date: '1932'
    description: >-
      In 1932, the “Percy House” (lot to the right of the Folly) caught fire and
      burned to the ground causing extensive damage to the residence. The cupola
      and all porches were removed from the house and it sat dormant for many
      years following the fire.
  - date: 1940’s
    description: >-
      Goodyear Tire purchased the property (and the adjacent Percy property) in
      the 1940’s and promptly expanded the “L” shaped house to be more
      symmetrical (as seen today).
  - date: 1950’s–1970’s
    description: >-
      The history of the now merged 1308 & 1310 properties are not quite clear
      from the early 50’s until 1977 when the house was purchased and re-modeled
      (interior) to be used as office and studio space.
  - date: '2004'
    description: >-
      LYN-CAG and a financial company used the building up until it’s recent
      owner bought the building in 2004.
  - date: Today
    description: >-
      The building, now known as “The Lighthouse” is a community center that
      utilizes all 5 floors of the historic property and is in good repair
      thanks to volunteers and donations from the local residents. The
      Lighthouse sees thousands of visitors yearly and serves the homeless and
      unemployed community with basic necessities and, most importantly, open
      arms.
