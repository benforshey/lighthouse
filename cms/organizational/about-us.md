Our Savior is in the business of restoration—shouldn't His followers also be? The Lighthouse Community Center is a faith-based nonprofit, a 501(c)(3) ministry of the [FARRR Foundation](http://farrrfoundation.org/), and a Trauma Informed Care organization serving the communities of Lynchburg since 2008. The Lighthouse operates as a day-shelter, providing a range of wrap-around supportive services. Through partnership with local businesses and the dedication of volunteers, we provide a wide range of [services](services/).

We firmly believe that there is no better way to make known God's passionate love for us than by providing radical hospitality. We embrace opportunities that push us to display acts of love with dignity. Our goal is that each person walking in through our doors feels the love of Christ. We love to greet with a smile, a handshake or a hug, and conclude with a new friendship through an act of prayer that shows appreciation for a Savior who is in the business of restoration.
